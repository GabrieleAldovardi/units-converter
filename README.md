## Functionalities
In the initial view is possible to select both the initial and final unit from the current selected group and also insert the initial value; these are the required selections needed to convert: when everything is set just press the "Convert" button.
It's also possible to change the unit group: to do it click, on the menu icon that is placed in the upper-left corner and select through the list which group is needed; to close this interface simply click on the upper-right corner "X" icon.
Lastly, is possible to exchange the the selected unit faster by clicking on the "Swap" icon: it's the icon placed between the two units with two arrows pointing to each unit.
